This is a demo website for club member registration.
It includes a login and signup page, as well as the ability to update a member's phone number. 
Data for all club members can be retrieved through the "/list" page, which also allows for retrieval of individual member data.
The list page and update phone number page are protected by JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. The database is connected to a MongoDB Atlas server. 
Although the frontend and backend are not currently connected,
the frontend can be viewed at https://taupe-brioche-034df6.netlify.app/ and the
backend can be accessed at https://club-registration.onrender.com/. The developer plans to connect the two in the future.
